When I was given the task of reimagining Be’lakor, I knew it would be a challenge as a designer, but one that I would certainly enjoy. Be’lakor is such an iconic Warhammer character, and his image is well known in both Warhammer Age of Sigmar and Warhammer 40,000, so I had a good starting point as a designer in terms of how he looks.

My brief was to update the classic model in plastic and give him a size worthy of his status, something that had always been difficult to achieve with metal and resin miniatures.

Designing a model of this size has many challenges. The main ones with Be’lakor were getting his anatomy right (as he is mostly unarmoured), the massive wings covered in chains, and the base he stands upon.

The body ended up mainly being an extensive anatomical study, followed by adding some suitably demonic textures and the iconic Chaos star on his chest.

The wings were particularly challenging, as I’d not sculpted many at this size before, so I had some conversations with fellow designers to set me on the right track. These had to be adorned with skulls and trophies, of course, which the original Be’lakor model had.
