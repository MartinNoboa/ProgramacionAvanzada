For the base, I wanted it to have a volcanic feel and almost encompass Be’lakor, like it’s closing around him. This adds to the chaotic nature of the landscape and gives the model a nice composition, which was something I was really focused on.

Overall I’m delighted with the finished miniature, and I’m really pleased that he has alternate parts for both Warhammer Age of Sigmar and Warhammer 40,000 – or if you prefer, you can simply leave these off, giving you the freedom to paint him and use him in either system!

It was also great to add in more options, such as the alternate faces and arm position. I loved both arm poses at the mock-up stage, so I decided to include both! Be’lakor was the most challenging sculpt of my career so far, but a project I certainly enjoyed – I’m looking forward to seeing him on the tabletop soon!
